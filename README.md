# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

* PLAN FOR CHECK-INS
    * Stand ups tentatively scheduled at 8:15 daily. To include:
        * Review and update project boardÂ 
        * Plan next steps
        * Who takes what methods
        * Solo/paired/group on that method
        * Announce (not solve) bug/code problems and plan on next steps to troubleshoot
        * If relevant, address any personal or team conflicts
* PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND WORKFLOW 
    * We will use Trello to assign tasks and monitor progress on those tasks. We will use our daily stand ups to update our Trello board and make changes as needed. 
    * Git workflow
        * Try to create branches by feature and do a pull request when a feature is completed
            * Send a message in Slack after you make a pull request (mark urgent as appropriate)
            * Respond in Slack if you are able to review
        * Segment off sections for each method to try to avoid merge conflicts

* PROJECT ORGANIZATION TOOLS 
    * We decided to use Trello because it was a new tool that we were interested in exploring. Devlin also had limited experience using Trello and found it user friendly and simple to use. 
* CODE DESIGN APPROACH 
    * Attempt to create compact classes with single responsibilities 
    * Try to group methods together in logical chunks
    * Create sample data from larger CSV files to facilitate testing
