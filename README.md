# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

* PLAN FOR CHECK-INS
    * Stand ups tentatively scheduled at 8:15 daily. To include:
        * Review and update project boardÂ 
        * Plan next steps
        * Assigning methods 
        * Announce (not solve) bug/code problems and plan on next steps to troubleshoot
        * If relevant, address any personal or team conflicts

* PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND WORKFLOW 
    * We will use Trello to assign tasks and monitor progress on those tasks. We will use our daily stand ups to update our Trello board and make changes as needed. 
    * Git workflow
        * Try to create branches by feature and do a pull request when a feature is completed
            * Send a message in Slack after you make a pull request (mark urgent as appropriate)
            * Respond in Slack if you are able to review
        * Segment off sections for each method to try to avoid merge conflicts

* PROJECT ORGANIZATION TOOLS 
    * We decided to use Trello because it was a new tool that we were interested in exploring. Devlin also had limited experience using Trello and found it user friendly and simple to use. 

* CODE DESIGN APPROACH 
    * Attempt to create compact classes with single responsibilities 
    * Try to group methods together in logical chunks
    * Create sample data from larger CSV files to facilitate testing 
    * Identify opportunities to streamline code and refactor as appropriate

* RETRO
    *  Tools used for our retro
       * How to Run an Effective Project Retrospective Meeting: 
            * https://www.smarttask.io/blog/project-retrospective-meeting
       * We chose to complete our retro using Jamboard because it is a tool that we are all comfortable with. We also agreed that Jamboard would allow us to easily document our thoughts.

    * Top 3 things that went well during our project
        * We communicated well and were responsive to each other's requests
        * We had compatible working preferences and were all comfortable working independently 
        * We learned a lot from reading other team member's code
    * Top things we would do differently next time
        * implement a system to avoid merge conflicts, such as segmenting off sections of files for each team member to work on
        * diagram/pseudocode to analyze difficulty level of methods
